This folder defines the objects in the simulation.

### Files

- `orbit_object.hpp/.cpp` — A simulation object representing a body with weight, size, and speed in orbit, such as a planet or moon.
- `central_mass.hpp/.cpp` — A static or central body (e.g., a star or black hole) that the other objects in this simulation orbit around. In this simulation, the central mass acts as the primary gravity source.
