# Physics

This folder contains math files that handle the calculations required for this simulation.

### Files

- `gravity.hpp/.cpp` — Uses gravitational force calculations between the simulation objects using Newtonian mechanics.
- `constants.hpp` — Stores global constants used in calculations such as gravitational constant `G`, time step size, and unit scale.
- `vector_math.hpp/.cpp` — Custom utilities for vector operations (e.g., normalization, magnitude, dot product).
